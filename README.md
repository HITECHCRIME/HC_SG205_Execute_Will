## Lyrics

```
CHORUS
clutching to my heart
show them what I want
never show em what I know
feeling like I'm gone
gotta fold you into naught 
got figured out it's mental
10 on 10 top decks on hold

VERSE (under construction)
put me on the jury, neverending fury
for free form willling execution
retribution got will to stand 
and not say a word

i will wait

i will wait for my tribute and constitution yeah
i will wait for my turn to break into x x x x 

judgemental
the executioner of hatred

```
