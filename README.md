## Lyrics

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDGJQ6NF5E

clutching to my heart, show them what I want
never show em what I know, feelin like I'm gone
gotta fold you into naught got figured out it's mental
10 on 10 top decks on hold

put me on the jury, neverending fury of
free form willling execution
retribution got will to stand and not say a word
i will wait for my tribute and constitution

judgemental
the executioner of hatred

put me on a hook, guarantee I hit the note
I could be teacher, maybe you should take a note
the boy got class, I be feelin hella bold
I can see the gold,
I ain't never going broke

```
