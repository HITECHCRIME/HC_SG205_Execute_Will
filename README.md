## Lyrics

```
CHORUS
clutching to my heart
show them what I want
never show em what I know
feeling like I'm gone

gotta fold you into naught 
got figured out it's mental
10 on 10 top decks on hold

VERSE (under construction)
put me on the jury, neverending fury
for free form willling execution
retribution got a will to stand 
and not say a word

TRANSITION
i will wait
i will wait for my tribute and constitution yeah
i will wait for my turn to break into x x x x 

VERSE (under construction)
judgemental
the executioner of hatred

CHORUS
clutching to my heart
show them what I want
never show em what I know
feeling like I'm gone

gotta fold you into naught 
got figured out it's mental
10 on 10 top decks on hold

SILENT BREAKDOWN
i will wait
i will wait for my tribute and constitution yeah
i will wait for my turn to break into x x x x 

VERSE
you and i got the same case
facing our own doubts ?

```
